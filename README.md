# Machine-Learning-San-Francisco-Crime-Classification

In this project, me and some colleagues used machine learning models to classify what type of crime took place (arson, murder, petty theft, etc.) given location and time of day. We also used the Folium python package to make some interactable visualizations with a topographical map of San Francisco.
