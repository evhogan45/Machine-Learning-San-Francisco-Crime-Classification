# Machine-Learning-San-Francisco-Crime-Classification

In this project, me and some colleagues used machine learning models to classify what type of crime took place (arson, murder, petty theft, etc.) given location and time of day. We also used the Folium python package to make some interactive visualizations with a topographical map of San Francisco. 

FINAL is in both html and IPYNB formats for convenience. It includes the machine learning classifier we used as well as the code that created the interactive maps. The only map that was small enough to post is wild_weekends, which is an interactive visualization of a random sample of 50,000 substance related crimes. To view it, you will have to download it and open the file in a web browser.
